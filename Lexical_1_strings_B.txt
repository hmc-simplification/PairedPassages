Strings were first made of sheep gut (commonly known as catgut), or simply gut, which was stretched, dried, and twisted. 
In the early years of the 20th century, strings were made of either gut, silk, aluminum, or steel. 
Modern strings may be gut, solid steel, stranded steel, or various synthetic materials, wound with various metals, and sometimes plated with silver. 
Most E strings are unwound, either plain or gold-plated steel. 
Currently, violin strings are not made with gut as much, but many performers use them to achieve a specific sound especially in historically informed performance.
