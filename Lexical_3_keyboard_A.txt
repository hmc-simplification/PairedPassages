In the beginning, keyboard keytops had a "dish shape" on top, like typewriters before them. 
Keyboard key legends must be extremely perdurable over tens of millions of depressions, since they are subjected to extreme mechanical deterioration from fingers and fingernails, and subject to hand oils and creams, so engraving and filling key legends with paint, as was done previously for individual switches, was never acceptable. 
So, for the first electronic keyboards, the key legends were manufactured by two-shot (or double-shot, or two-color) molding.
