O, never shall sun that morrow see! 
Your face, my thane, is as a book where men may read strange matters. 
To beguile the time, look like the time. Bear welcome in your eye, your hand, your tongue. 
Look like th' innocent flower, but be the serpent under 't. 
He that's coming must be provided for; and you shall put this night's great business into my dispatch, which shall to all our nights and days to come give solely sovereign sway and masterdom.
