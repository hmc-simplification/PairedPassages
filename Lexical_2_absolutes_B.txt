The man who refuses to judge, who neither agrees nor disagrees, who declares that there are no absolutes and believes that he escapes responsibility, is the man responsible for all the blood that is now spilled in the world. 
Reality is an absolute, existence is an absolute, a speck of dust is an absolute and so is a human life. 
Whether you live or die is an absolute. Whether you have a piece of bread or not, is an absolute. 
Whether you eat your bread or see it vanish into a lobster's stomach, is an absolute.
